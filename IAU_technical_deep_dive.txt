Ideal Asset Utilization (IAU) System - Technical Deep Dive

Overview:
The IAU system is a modular, multi-agent AI solution for retail inventory optimization. It leverages advanced AI/ML models and LLMs (OpenAI GPT, HuggingFace Transformers) to identify stagnant inventory, recommend liquidation strategies, automate campaigns, and provide analytics, all while adhering to responsible AI principles.

Architecture:
- Inventory Data Ingestion: Loads product data from CSV, database, or API into InventoryItem objects.
- Agents:
  1. Inventory Detection Agent: Uses rule-based logic or ML models to flag stagnant items based on last sold date, expiry, and seasonality.
  2. Recommendation Agent: Integrates with LLMs (OpenAI GPT, HuggingFace) or uses rule-based logic to generate contextual liquidation strategies, leveraging a knowledge base.
  3. Campaign Agent: Automates sales campaigns for flagged items, with potential integration to marketing platforms (email, SMS, POS APIs).
  4. Analytics Agent: Visualizes stagnant items and recommendations using Streamlit, with options for advanced analytics and BI integration.
- Responsible AI Layer: Implements fairness, security, privacy, and compliance (GDPR, audit trails).

Key Technologies:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit (dashboard)
- HuggingFace Transformers (LLMs)
- OpenAI API (GPT models)
- Pandas, NumPy (data handling)
- Modular agent-based design (agents/ folder)

Workflow:
1. Inventory data is loaded and parsed into InventoryItem objects.
2. Inventory Detection Agent flags stagnant items using configurable thresholds and logic.
3. Recommendation Agent queries LLMs or applies rules to generate liquidation strategies, using a knowledge base for context.
4. Campaign Agent launches sales campaigns, optionally integrating with external marketing systems.
5. Analytics Agent displays results and insights on a dashboard.

LLM Integration:
- OpenAI GPT: API key required; prompts are constructed for contextual recommendations.
- HuggingFace Transformers: Local or hosted models; pipeline used for text generation.
- Model selection is configurable via the recommendation agent's arguments.

Extensibility:
- Agents can be replaced or extended (e.g., ML-based detection, advanced analytics, ERP/CRM integration).
- Knowledge base can be expanded for richer recommendations.
- Data sources can be adapted for real-time or batch processing.

Responsible AI:
- Explainable, auditable models.
- Data encryption and access controls.
- Privacy compliance (anonymization, GDPR).
- Legal compliance and audit trails.

Deployment:
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
- Run main.py for orchestration, or individual agents for modular operation.
- Use Streamlit for dashboard visualization.

This solution is designed for scalability, flexibility, and ethical AI deployment in retail environments.
